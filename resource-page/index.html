                <h2>Why Quality Matters</h2>
                <p>The pressure to cut costs, increase margins and invest in transformative technologies often leaves
                  little
                  left to spend on quality. However, these pressures can lead to a status quo approach to quality that
                  can
                  eventually result in compliance problems, damage to brand reputation and revenue losses.</p>

                <p>The fast pace of modern society means that companies
                  who fail to keep up with the latest business trends and
                  technology are in danger of becoming the dinosaurs
                  of the business world. For many, the cost of doing nothing was a slow descent

                <h2>How to Select a Quality Management System: 7 Key Elements for Successful Implementation</h2>
                <p>In many organizations today, implementing a
                  software-based quality management system (QMS)
                  is a strategic priority for operational excellence.
                  As demand for QMS solutions grows, so does the
                  vendor landscape, complicating decisions over which
                  choice will ensure a successful implementation and
                  facilitate mission-critical quality initiatives.</p>

                <p>Document control software that automates document
                  creation, approval, distribution and archiving is the
                  cornerstone of quality, environmental health and
                  safety (EHS). In this white paper, we look at eight
                  elements of an effective document control system
                  and explore the benefits of using document control
                  to drive operational excellence. </p>

                <p>In 2018,
                  United Airlines redesigned its inflight magazine
                  to weigh an ounce less than the previous issues saving the company $290,000 in fuel and operating
                  costs.
                  This perfectly illustrates a paradigm shift within
                  competitive markets; gone are the days of relying on
                  the old company adage, “this is how it’s always been
                  done.” Business leaders now ask, “how can it be done
                  smarter, faster and easier?” </p>

                  and
                  damage to brand reputation of a single recall, organizations must proactively manage supplier quality.

            <h2>The Rise of Quality as a Strategic Business Initiative</h2>
            <p>ETQ engaged leading research firm, Salloway Associates, to survey 300 C-level executives, quality and IT
              managers to learn key trends and common challenges with their quality initiatives. This first-of-its-kind
              survey uncovered an important shift how organizations are treating quality – today, more organizations
              view quality as a strategic initiative, not just a compliance need. In fact, survey data shows 66% of
              organizations categorize quality as a strategic growth investment with and average ROI on quality programs
              of 23%. This ebook also includes the results of an additional survey on the business and quality process
              impacts of COVID-19.</p>

            <p>In many organizations today, implementing a
              software-based quality management system (QMS)
              is a strategic priority for operational excellence.
              As demand for QMS solutions grows, so does the

            <h2>Risk Management Software</h2>
            <p>The latest revisions of ISO standards require companies to apply risk-based thinking in their
              process planning, operations and performance evaluation. To embrace this shift, risk must be
              considered in every quality activity. Having tools to identify, mitigate and report on risk lets you
              seamlessly incorporate risk into all processes rather than keeping it a siloed activity. Quality conscious
              companies visualize, streamline and share their most critical process information to
              turn risk insight into action that transforms quality and compliance into market advantage. </p>

            <p>Nearly 4 in 5 Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) professionals recognize that risk management is a
              key
              factor in achieving EHS goals, yet mitigating risk with technology remains a challenge.</p>

            <h2>Your Ultimate Guide to Employee Safety</h2>
            <p>The best way to reduce incident rates in your workplace is to create a total safety culture,
              where employee safety is a company-wide priority. This requires company-wide
              buy-in, comprehensive training and full communication from the top level down. </p>

            <h2>Getting Started with Risk in ISO 9001:2015</h2>
            <p>The old
              mindset of using corrective and preventive actions to deal with
              adverse events has been replaced with the risk-driven approach,
              aiming to prevent it from happening rather than recovering
              once it happens. For those that are new to Risk Management,
              however, this can be a challenging shift. Not only do business
              leaders need to understand the latest standard, they need to
              understand the role of risk and the tools available to them to
              help manage risk.</p>

            <h2>Key Changes in ISO 9001:2015</h2>
            <p>ISO 9001:2015 brought with it a mindset shift. While the requirements are still there, the 2015 revisions
              encourage organizations to focus on the final goal: delivering consistent quality to customers through
              people and processes. The flexibility inherent in those changes laid the groundwork for integrating
              technology configured to work with a particular organization’s processes and workflows.

            <p>According to Gartner, disruptive technologies, rapidly-shifting economic conditions and expanding supply
              bases are challenging traditional approaches to quality management, strategy and leadership.This new
              Gartner research is particularly relevant in the current crisis and can serve as a template as you plan to
              adapt. Shifting the focus from production into design and across the extended supply chain has allowed
              companies to identify and respond to quality errors earlier in the product life cycle, saving time and
              reducing cost of quality.</p>

            <p>New Product Introduction (NPI) is fundamental to most industrial organizations, yet 44% of new product
              launches fail to meet all of their success criteria. LNS Research has defined a 3-step plan for improving

            <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dan Jacob, Principal Analyst and Research Director, LNS Research</p>
            <p>Successful new product introduction (NPI) is crucial to achieve corporate goals. But today’s NPI success
              rate is relatively low largely due to historical NPI challenges combined with market trends including
              increased visibility to product performance and quality, global pressures, and increasingly complex
              products. Quality leaders that see deep engagement in NPI as their holy grail may be surprised that the
              levers for that engagement exist today.</p>
