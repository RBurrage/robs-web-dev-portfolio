                            <strong>Major Initiatives/Accomplishments:</strong> I instantiated GIT on a server that
                            previously had no version control, and in doing so retained records of all updates to the
                            public website. I created a filterable Resource page for all of ETQ’s assets enhancing the
                            user experience by allowing the user to sort by three different categories. Prior to the
                            creation of the new page, hundreds of resources could be browsed, but the user had to scroll
                            through the entire page to find what she was looking for.
