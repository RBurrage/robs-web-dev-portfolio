              <p>ETQ customers requested that we move the conference to a spring schedule. ETQ Quality Vision 2020 is
                now the traditional ETQ customer conference with the new Quality Leadership Forum
                on the afternoon of the first day, two full days of product strategy sessions, The Customer Innovation
                Awards, and two days of training. The fall 2019 Product Strategy &amp; Training Conference was a shorter
                conference for customers to facilitate the adjustment to a spring schedule. It included one day of
                product strategy sessions and two days of training sessions. Following our March 2020 conference, the
                next ETQ customer conference will be held in spring 2021.
